## Project Description
Per the slides presented in class on Installation and Deployment
Install and deploy a multi-node computing service on CloudLab’s OpenStack Cloud or on Docker’s Kubernetes

### Project Primary Task: 
Select a computing service consisting of at least two service nodes (i.e., a web server with a backend SQL server OR a Single-Sign-On LDAP server that supports a networked file system server …) and deploy the corresponding VMs/containers inside CloudLab’s Openstack infrastructure or Kubernetes infrastructure. 
### Project Subtasks:
Able to setup VM nodes (possibly on local computers) that work together to provide a unified computing service to users. 
Able to move these VM nodes into the Cloud, setup proper network environment, and link them together. 
Able to setup at least 2-3 security groups/Docker subnet (DO NOT use the default security groups (Openstack) or Docker default network)
